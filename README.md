**Project Title:** Uber Trip Analysis
**Completion Date:** May 2025

**Overview**
This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover trends in ride frequency, peak travel times, and geographic usage patterns. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that could inform ride optimization strategies, urban mobility planning, or targeted marketing campaigns.

**Objectives**
- Analyze trip volume trends over time
- Identify peak hours, days, and seasons for Uber usage
- Explore geographic patterns in trip origins and destinations
- Visualize temporal and spatial dynamics of urban transportation

**Methods**
- Time Series Analysis: Daily and hourly trend analysis of ride frequency
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Trip duration, distance, and fare patterns
- Geospatial Mapping: Heatmaps of pickup and drop-off locations
- Aggregation and Grouping: Analysis by time, location, and ride category

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Geospatial Tools (Folium, Geopandas)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Key Findings**
- Weekday commute hours (7–9 AM and 5–7 PM) saw the highest trip volumes
- Downtown and airport zones were the most frequent pickup/drop-off areas
- Seasonal effects were visible, with a drop in winter and spike during summer months
- Mapping revealed concentrated high-traffic corridors useful for demand planning

**Ethical Considerations**
- All data was anonymized and used for analytical purposes only

Visualizations ensured that no personally identifiable information was exposed

Conclusions were framed with respect to public mobility and transportation ethics
